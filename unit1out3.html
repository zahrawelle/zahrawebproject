    <h1 class="center">Unit 1, Outcome 3 (Review) </h1>

<p>
    <h4 class="center">Unit 3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams? </h4><br><br>
    If we were to code the website in a team environment, we would all have decide together which layout we would use for the index, who would code a section of the webpage. The productivity and efficiency in a group project would maximise, because we’ll on the same boat in regard to timing and you can ask them for help if your having troubleshoot. The productivity and efficiency in a solo project would be easygoing because it your project, you don’t have to worry about the group collective and you have full autonomy and creative control.<br><br>
    Regardless if you’re doing a project individually or doing a project collectively you’ll still suffer the trial and tribulations of the project
</p>

<p>
    <h4 class="center">Unit 3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h4><br><br>  
To improve productivity and efficiency is to plan your day out, schedule what task you need to do, add in when your going to have a break to rest, eat and whine down. <br>
Figure out what helps you focus and what distracts you.

<p>
    <h4 class="center">Unit 3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</h4><br>
    <br>To help me improve my productivity, I used Trello Board to keep my task in check. For resources I keep note of it such as Slack to use to download course material. The Slack channel and Zoom call class were helpful because if someone need help, we could answer them. If I were to do the website project and the other coding project I did in Week 2, I would have used <a href="https://www.codegrepper.com/index.php">Grepper</a> to help solve my troubleshoot.
</p>

<p>
    <h4 class="center">Unit 3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions </h4><br><br> 
    When I started to build my website on Visual Studio Code, I started with the HTML for the foundation before I can preview it. I need to get an extension called Live Server which helps you see your website on Safari or Google Chrome, right click and select Open with Live Server and you can see you’re website. Live Server help me give me a visualise on my project and keeps track on my progression. Once the website is complete I plan to launch it on Github which will store my code and show as a portfolio.
