    <h1 class="center">About Me</h1>
    <p> <h4 class="center">I'm a eclectic, a ambivert and a wild card.</h4></p>
    <p> Hello, My name is Zahra, I’m a code nation student learning about coding from London, United Kingdom. <br>
       </p>

    <p>My hobbies are very eclectic; I am a music enthusiast, during my time at university I was a vocalist in a band and love to make and compose music; a bibliolater who is especially interested in history. <br><br>
        During my spare time, I like computing and coding, socialising with my family and friends, shopping, watching TV and films. I also took a leap of faith in 2015 and attended a beginner’s jewellery making course at Barnet and Southgate College.</p>
