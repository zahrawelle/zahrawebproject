    <h4 class="center">Unit 1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites.</h4><br><br>
    When William Hogarth started his comic strip-like portraiture, he gained renowned fame for his bawdy social and satirical commentary of life in Georgian era of Great Britain. But when people start copying his prints and selling them in Hogarth style, Hogarth went to parliament to complain about his work being stolen and lobby for protection of his and other people’s work. Later parliament issued the Engraving Copyright Act 1734, which protects the original works from artistes; it is also called Hogarth's Act. [22][26]<br><br>

    This brief history of Hogarth is how copyright came to be; it protect original creators and innovators work from be stolen or misused, people have to be careful using other people’s works to use for their own project. The have to gain permission from the original owner, add fair dealing/fair use or use original works which in public domain. [21]

    <h4 class="center">Unit 1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them.</h4><br><br>
    The Internet is accessible to all, but for those who are disabled that is a different side of the story. Some website have web accessibility, which helps people with disabilities use the web. [23]<br><br>

    Some disabilities are ranged from; permanent, temporary and situational, for explain permanent disability is someone who can’t use a part of their body, temporary disability is someone who is injured and their body part is healing and situational is someone who limited access for example someone is holding a baby and is using the computer. [24][33]
</p>


<p>
    There are many way to make you website web accessibility:<br> 
    <ul>
        <li><b>Visual Impairment </b> — Websites have alt tags to read out the tag to the screen reader to describe a photo “The photo is black and white, a blonde women is a actress named Marilyn Monroe. Marilyn is wearing a white dress, standing on the air vents on the streets of New York City. Her skirt blows up and Marilyn tries to keep here dress down.”</li><br>
        <li><b>Hearing Impairment</b> – Website try to provide subtitles and transcripts for people who are deaf, hard of hearing or suffering hearing loss. YouTube for example has subtitles for some of their videos for other viewers in different counties and the deaf community. </li><br>
        <li><b>Motor Skills/Physical Disabilities</b> – For people who have Motor Skills/Physical Disabilities, They need their keyboard to be accessible. For example:</li><br>
    <UL TYPE="square">   
        <li>You can have a virtual keyboard to interact with the computer.</li></p>
           <li>Vertical Keyboard with Mouth Stick.</li><br>
           <li>One-Handed Keyboard.</li><br>
           <li>Speech Recognition  - Which allow the user to speak to the computer. [34]</li></UL><br>
    <li><b>Photosensitive Seizures</b> – For people who suffer from epilepsy, any file-type content on the Internet can trigger a seizure. [30] Website must keep any flashes minimal and allow user to custom flash rate limit.  [31] </li> <br>
    <li><b>Cognitive Disabilities</b> – Cognitive Disabilities have a ranging spectrum from Cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities. Some behavioural and mental health disorders have been part of the nervous system and impact how well people hear, move, see, speak, and understand information. [25]</li><br>   
    <UL TYPE="square">  
        <li>Some websites will simplify labels and instruction to write in sign up forms for example when you’re typing your date of birth they’ll tell you how it should be written ‘DD-MM-YYYY e.g. the 1st of June 2000 is 01-06-2000. [32]</li><br>
          <li>Some website will put an Images, icons and graphic content to help people with Dyslexia visual the information. [32]</li><br>
          <li>For people who have memory impairment or learning disabilities, websites have suggestions and auto-complete functionality to help people complete the sentence. [32]</li></UL><br>
    </ul>
        </p>

<p> 
    <h4 class="center">Unit 1.7 Describe, which are the appropriate file-types for websites.</h4><br>
When you’re building a website, it’s like your building a house. HTML is the foundations; the bricks, cements and installation, CSS is the decorations; the furniture, the paint, the tiles and the whole décor. File-types falls in middle between them, though they have the same agenda they have different ways to utilise them for media, images and documents. [27]
