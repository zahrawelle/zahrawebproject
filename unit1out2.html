<p> 
    <h4 class="center">Unit 2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h4> 
<br><br> I'm happy with tools that have be bestowed to me and resources that help me, Before I learnt about CSS flex box, I inputed my own menu bar and was considering add a drop down navigation bar in HTML for example:
<br><!--menu here--> 
<h6 class="center"><a href="index.html">Home</a> | <a href="aboutme.html">About Me</a> | <a href="unit1.html">Unit1</a>  | <a href="unit1out2.html">Unit1, Outcome 2</a>  | <a href="unit1out3.html">Unit1, Outcome 3</a> |  <a href="unit2.html">Unit2, Outcome 1</a> | <a href="unit_ref.html">Unit References</a> | <a href="contact.html">Contacts</a> | </h6><br>
<p>Now that I have inputed the CSS flex box, it makes the website look better.</p>

<p>
    <h4 class="center">Unit 2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h4><br>
    I appreciate the fact, that I can use Visual Studio Code to help me code my website. Since beginning of the course it is the coding software that I use for code in Python, HTML & CSS. Using Trello Board has help me organise my project and what task that I need to do. 
</p>


<p>
    <h4 class="center">Unit 2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?</h4><br><br> 
    I’m contented with how I finished with the project, I wish I had more time to improve it or learn more HTML and CSS code like a drop down menu, but with this project I need to focus more on the text of my units, then the design.<br><br>
    If I were to do it again it would be to do more research, experiment with different type of HTML & CSS codes.</p>

<p><h4 class="center">Unit 2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project.</h4><br> 
    I could have made the website more avant-garde then minimalistic, but I had to be realistic in my coding. I would have loved to make the website more sophisticated and professional but time was limited. Also I would have looked more into CSS techniques and styles.
</p>

<p>
    <h4 class="center">Unit 2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose </h4><br>
    I utilised everything that I learnt, I produced every conduct on Visual Studio Code using HTML & CSS codes to build my website. I look at it and see if the website is going well or not.
